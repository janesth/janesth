## What's up 👋

My name is Janes Thomas (he/him) and I'm a Full Stack Software Engineer based in [Winterthur, ZH, Switzerland](https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/1682243).
I am currently working for and doing very cool things at [@tocco](https://github.com/tocco). Formely I was employed by [@merkle-open](https://github.com/merkle-open) - a subsidiary of [dentsu](https://www.dentsu.com/). And before Merkle, I was working at [Namics](https://www.consultancy.eu/news/2028/dentsu-aegis-merkle-buys-digital-agency-in-switzerland-and-germany).

My specialties include Java, teaching programming and cooking/eating (mainly) Italian food.

I'm working on personal projects or here on GitHub, hence all the commits into private repositories. I'm not hiding things, I promise!

If you want to reach me for anything really, send me a message via email: [work@yoinc.ch](mailto:work@yoinc.ch)
