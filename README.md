## What's up 👋

My name is Janes Thomas (he/him) and I'm a Full Stack Software Engineer based in [Winterthur, ZH, Switzerland](https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/1682243).
I am preparing to work and do very cool things at ███████. Formerly I was employed by [@tocco](https://github.com/tocco) helping them build their ERP system also named Tocco. Before Tocco I've had a long stint at [@merkle-open](https://github.com/merkle-open) - a subsidiary of [dentsu](https://www.dentsu.com/) working on various SAP Commerce projects for clients across Switzerland. And before Merkle, I was working at [Namics](https://www.consultancy.eu/news/2028/dentsu-aegis-merkle-buys-digital-agency-in-switzerland-and-germany) doing the same things I was doing at Merkle.

My specialties include Java, teaching programming and cooking/eating (mainly) Italian food. 

I'm working on personal projects here on GitHub or help out friends with their projects, hence all the commits into private repositories. I'm not hiding things, I promise!

If you want to say hi or ask me something, send me a message via email: [work@yoinc.ch](mailto:work@yoinc.ch)
